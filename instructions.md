Internal Call Dashboard Development Guide

Overview:
Develop a fast, lightweight, and responsive dashboard website for internal use, displaying call data
from an IP phone system using its API.

1. Tools
Frontend Frameworks:
- React
Component/UI Libraries:
- Tailwind CSS, ShadCN/UI, Radix UI, Material UI
- Recharts, ApexCharts, Chart.js (for charts)
State Management:
- React Query, SWR (for API fetching/caching)
- Zustand, Context API (for local state)
Backend (optional):
- Node.js + Express
- Python FastAPI
API Tools:
- Axios, fetch
- Postman, Insomnia
Authentication (for internal access):
- IP whitelisting, Bearer tokens, Basic auth
- Option of showing the data dashboard with no authentication, just a very long obfuscated URL with a UUID
Deployment:
- Docker + NGINX (self-hosted)
2. Development Process
1. Requirements & Planning
 - Define key metrics, chart types, update frequency
2. Setup
 - Use Vite or Next.js
 - Tailwind + UI library setup
3. API Integration
 - Axios/fetch
 - React Query/SWR for handling data
4. UI Components
 - Cards, tables, charts
5. Optimization
 - Lazy loading, memoization, minimize dependencies
6. Security
 - Basic auth or IP restriction
 - Input validation
7. Testing
 - Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress
8. Deployment
- Docker
3. Dashboard Features (for Call Data)
Key Metrics:
- Total Calls, Avg Duration, Missed Calls, Active Calls
Charts:
- Call Volume Over Time (line/bar)
- Call Status Breakdown (donut/pie)
- Top Extensions (bar/list)
Detailed Call Log Table:
- Timestamp, From, To, Duration, Status, Type
Chart Libraries:
- Recharts, ApexCharts, Chart.js
API Tips:
- Use caching (React Query)
- Format timestamps and durations
- Handle rate limits gracefully
Optional Enhancements:
- Dark mode
- WebSocket support for real-time updates
- Export to CSV/PDF
